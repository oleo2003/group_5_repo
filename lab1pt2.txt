After checking the GitHub repository, the main reason you cannot replicate the studyâ€™s findings is that the repository only provides code and pretrained weights for running inference, not the full training pipeline. The original study required massive computational resources and access to curated versions of large biological databases that are either proprietary, extremely large, or difficult to reconstruct. Additionally, the training involved self-distillation and specialized data processing steps that are not part of the open-source release. In other words, you can use the GitHub repository to generate new protein structure predictions with the released models, but you cannot replicate the training process or reproduce the experimental benchmarking results from the paper.
