Reading from the paper “Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold” relies on several foundational references that shaped its approach. First, it draws heavily on earlier discussions of the protein folding problem, particularly Anfinsen’s principles of protein folding and Dill’s review of the folding problem, which establish the biological challenge. It also builds on previous computational advances, including deep learning–based protein structure prediction from Senior et al. (2020), which introduced an earlier version of AlphaFold. From machine learning, Vaswani et al.’s "Attention Is All You Need" paper is central and essentially undergirds the transformer-based Evoformer architecture. On the bioinformatics side, the paper depends on massive sequence resources such as UniProt, MGnify, and the BFD database, as well as bioinformatics tools like HHblits, jackhmmer, and MMseqs2 for multiple sequence alignments. The overall assessment of the paper's accuracy is seen in the CASP benchmarks, which provide the blind test environment to validate AlphaFold’s performance. These references cohesively and competely form the methodological and conceptual backbone of the paper.
