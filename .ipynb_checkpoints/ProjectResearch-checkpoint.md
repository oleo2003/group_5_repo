Paper 1: Identifying drug targets for neurological and psychiatric disease via genetics and the brain transcriptome 
    
    Paper Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009224

    Summary: This 2021 paper uses Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analysis to identify potential drug targets for neurological and psychiatric diseases by linking brain gene expression to disease risk.

    Methodology: Combined two-sample MR (to establish causal relationships) with Bayesian colocalization (to confirm shared genetic variants) using brain-specific expression data rather than blood proxies

Paper 2: Using the structure of genome data in the design of deep neural networks for predicting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from 
genotype

    Paper Link: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i538/5529261

    Summary: This paper uses deep learning in an attempt to identify disease-associated genetic varients of regulatory egions that may be  associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

    The code for this seems to me to be feasible for our project. The only language used is python and the raw files are not very long. This project also uses many python tools that we has been discussed in the content of our lectures. For examples, they make use of libraries such as pandas and numpy as well as pytorch and scikitlearn. This could be useful in learning how these different tools can be utilized to analyze biological data to produce meaningful results. The only thing that might cause issues is I am not sure if the text file included is the correct dataset needed to run through this code. 

Paper 3: Prediction of Alzheimer's disease based on deep neural network by integrating gene expression and DNA methylation dataset 
   
    Paper Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419305834

    Summary: This paper uses genomic data and methylation sites on DNA to create an Alzheimer's Diseases  prediction model.

    This code seems like it might work. It is mostly python with just a little bit of R, which our engineer has some experience with so it should'nt cause too many issues. It doesn't seem like there is anything too complicated regarding the prediction models that the code implements however the datasets included are very large and it may take a long time to get the code to run.
