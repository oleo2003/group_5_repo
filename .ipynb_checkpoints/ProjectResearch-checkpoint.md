## Paper 1  
### **Identifying Drug Targets for Neurological and Psychiatric Disease via Genetics and the Brain Transcriptome**

**Paper Link:**  
https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009224  

**Summary:**  
This 2021 paper uses Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analysis to identify potential drug targets for neurological and psychiatric diseases by linking brain gene expression to disease risk.

**Methodology:**  
Combined two-sample MR (to establish causal relationships) with Bayesian colocalization (to confirm shared genetic variants) using brain-specific expression data rather than blood proxies.

**Notes:**  
- Code is **not accessible**, which may limit reproducibility or use in our project.

## Paper 2  
### **Using the Structure of Genome Data in the Design of Deep Neural Networks for Predicting ALS from Genotype**

**Paper Link:**  
https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i538/5529261  

**Summary:**  
This paper uses deep learning to identify disease-associated genetic variants in regulatory regions that may be linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

**GitHub Link:**  
https://github.com/byin-cwi/ALS-Deeplearning  

**Notes:**  
- The code is feasible for our project.  
- Fully written in Python; files are not very long.  
- Uses tools from lectures (**pandas**, **numpy**, **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**).  
- May be useful for learning how these tools analyze biological data.  
- Some uncertainty if the included text file is the correct dataset for running the code.

## Paper 3  
### **Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Deep Neural Network Integrating Gene Expression and DNA Methylation**

**Paper Link:**  
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419305834  

**Summary:**  
This paper integrates genomic data and DNA methylation features to build a model predicting Alzheimer’s disease.

**GitHub Link:**  
https://github.com/ChihyunPark/DNN_for_ADprediction  

**Notes:**  
- Code is mostly Python, with a little R.  
- Prediction model is not overly complicated.  
- Large datasets may make the pipeline slow to run.
