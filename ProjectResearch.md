Paper 1:

Identifying drug targets for neurological and psychiatric disease via genetics and the brain transcriptome 
(https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009224)

This paper aims to use various data anlysis methods to identify genetic variants that may modulate the expression, and therefore 
efficacy, of drug-therapy targets.

Paper 2: 

Using the structure of genome data in the design of deep neural networks for predicting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from 
genotype (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i538/5529261)

This paper uses deep learning to in attempt to identify disease-associated genetic varients of regulatory egions that may be 
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
