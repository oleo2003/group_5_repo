Summary: This paper examines the cohesive application of 3 machine learning models to analyze epigenome regulator G9a and its influence on the nervous system, particularly in regulation the translation of hippocampal proteins. The models examined were based on data provided by PubChem and performed by algorithms interpreted by the scikit-learn Python-based ML library to screen compounds and then use docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinities with Alzheimer’s-related protein targets.

Notes:
* The code is feasible for our project
* written in Python
* uses libraries familiar from class (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)
* May be useful for learning how these tools analyze biological data
* Dataset and instructions are clearly documented in the GitHub repo
