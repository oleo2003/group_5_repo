Paper 1
Targeting neurodegeneration: three machine learning methods for G9a inhibitors discovery using PubChem and scikit-learn

Paper Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-025-00642-z#data-and-code-availability

Summary: This paper examines the cohesive application of 3 machine learning models to analyze epigenome regulator G9a and its influence on the nervous system, particularly in regulation the translation of hippocampal proteins. The models examined were based on data provided by PubChem and performed by algorithms interpreted by the scikit-learn Python-based ML library to screen compounds and then use docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinities with Alzheimer’s-related protein targets.

Dual inhibition of AChE and MAO-B in Alzheimer’s disease: machine learning approaches and model interpretations

Paper Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11030-024-11061-x?fromPaywallRec=false#Abs1

Summary: This paper describes how five machine learning algorithms, four fingerprints, and DRAGON descriptors were combined to develop 25 classification models that were used to examine dual-target inhibition of Acetylchonesterase (AChE) and Monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) in treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Notes:
* The code is feasible for our project
* Largely written in Python, with additional .csv files
* Shorter paper with clear figures


Paper 3
A machine-learning based objective measure for ALS disease severity

Paper Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00588-8#Abs1

Summary: This paper attempts to model an objective way of measuring severity of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which has previously only been measured through subjective Functional Rating Scale. A machine learning based measure of ALS severity  based off of a longitudinal dataset of voice recording and accelerometer samples evaluated the efficacy of the edaravone drug.

Notes:
* The code is feasible for our project
* Code is written in Python and cohesively organized on Github
* Very short paper with clear language

Paper 4
At-home wearables and machine learning sensitively capture disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Paper Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40917-3#Abs1

Summary: This study uses wearable sensors and machine-learning analysis of natural limb movements to generate an objective, sensitive measure of ALS progression that outperforms traditional clinical rating scales and could reduce clinical trial sample sizes.

Notes:
* The case is pertinent to our groups conversation 
* Github code seems to be in Matlab format


Paper 5
Classification of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with comorbid traits and deep learning algorithms

Paper Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40917-3#Abs1

Summary: This study shows that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) from traits comorbid with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression can accurately classify and distinguish these disorders, even without disorder-specific genetic information, by combining target specific PRS with PRSs of comorbid traits.

Notes: 
* Feasible for our project
* Code is in python

Paper 6
Deep learning-based polygenic scores enhance generalizability of psychiatric disorders prediction

Paper Link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12083566/#ABS1

Summary: This study finds that deep learning and linear models perform similarly for predicting psychiatric disorders from genetic data, but deep learning shows slightly better generalization for some traits by combining individual-level, GWAS-based, and family genetic risk scores.

Notes: 
* I am not sure what format Github code is in…it seems that there are multiple formats? 
* This paper has not been reviewed by a journal officially. Can we still use it?

Notes: 
* Really interesting topic for public healthcare admin, but I am not sure how publicly available data is for use

Paper 8
Multimodal Machine Learning Workflows for Prediction of Psychosis in Patients With Clinical High-Risk Syndromes and Recent-Onset Depression

Paper Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2773732

Summary: This study looks for a transition to psychosis be predicted in patients with clinical high-risk states or recent-onset depression by optimally integrating clinical, neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic information with clinicians’ prognostic estimates. Personalized prevention is utilized via prognostic workflows

Notes: 
* Data was analyzed a while ago (2019-2020), so may not be runnable. 
* Also, the reproducibility is weak because of the model of individual prognostic estimates it seems

Identifying the neurodevelopmental and psychiatric signatures of genomic disorders associated with intellectual disability: a machine learning approach

Paper Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13229-023-00549-2

Summary: A simple screening tool to identify young people with genomic conditions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND-GCs) who could benefit from further support would be of considerable value. We used machine learning approaches to address this question.
