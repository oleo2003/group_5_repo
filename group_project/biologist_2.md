Paper 1
Targeting neurodegeneration: three machine learning methods for G9a inhibitors discovery using PubChem and scikit-learn

Paper Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-025-00642-z#data-and-code-availability

Summary: This paper examines the cohesive application of 3 machine learning models to analyze epigenome regulator G9a and its influence on the nervous system, particularly in regulation the translation of hippocampal proteins. The models examined were based on data provided by PubChem and performed by algorithms interpreted by the scikit-learn Python-based ML library to screen compounds and then use docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinities with Alzheimer’s-related protein targets.

Notes:
* The code is feasible for our project
* .ipynb file type
* uses libraries familiar from class (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)
* May be useful for learning how these tools analyze biological data
* Dataset and instructions are clearly documented in the GitHub repo

Dual inhibition of AChE and MAO-B in Alzheimer’s disease: machine learning approaches and model interpretations

Paper Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11030-024-11061-x?fromPaywallRec=false#Abs1

Summary: This paper describes how five machine learning algorithms, four fingerprints, and DRAGON descriptors were combined to develop 25 classification models that were used to examine dual-target inhibition of Acetylchonesterase (AChE) and Monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) in treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Notes:
* The code is feasible for our project
* Largely written in Python, with additional .csv files
* Shorter paper with clear figures
