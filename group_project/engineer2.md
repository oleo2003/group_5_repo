### Paper 1 – Targeting Neurodegeneration: three machine learning methods for G9a inhibitors discovery Using PubChem and scikit-learn

- **Link to paper**: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-025-00642-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-025-00642-z)
- **Code repo**: [https://github.com/articlesmli/G9a_Inhibitors_efficacy](https://github.com/articlesmli/G9a_Inhibitors_efficacy)

**What we tried**

- Cloned repo
- Opened the README to find how to run
- Attempted running from jupyter notebook

**What went wrong**

- No instruction in the README, only links to datasets
- After modifying first step of repo, realized that there was too much pre-processing to continue working on this project

**Conclusion**

- Could have been interesting, but required too much work for a short-term project

### Paper 2 - Dual inhibition of AChE and MAO-B in Alzheimer’s disease: machine learning approaches and model interpretations

- **Link to paper**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11030-024-11061-x?fromPaywallRec=false#Abs1
- **Code repo**: https://github.com/houzhe122/AChE-MAOB-Models

**What we tried**

- Cloned repo to run on terminal, since we are working with .py files
- Creating environments to run code

**What went wrong**

- No readme, but maybe because it's all python code
- Datasets missing while running

**Conclusion**

- Cannot run normally as excel file is missing from repository
