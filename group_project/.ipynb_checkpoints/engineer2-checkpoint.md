- **Code repo**: [https://github.com/articlesmli/G9a_Inhibitors_efficacy](https://github.com/articlesmli/G9a_Inhibitors_efficacy)

**What we tried**

- Opened the README to find how to run
- Attempted running from jupyter notebook

**What went wrong**

- No instruction in readme, only links to datasets
- After modifying first step of repo, realized that there was too much pre-processing to continue working on this project

**Conclusion**

- Could have been interesting, but required too much work for a short-term project
