### Paper 1 – Targeting Neurodegeneration: three machine learning methods for G9a inhibitors discovery Using PubChem and scikit-learn

- **Link to paper**: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-025-00642-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-025-00642-z)
- **Code repo**: [https://github.com/articlesmli/G9a_Inhibitors_efficacy](https://github.com/articlesmli/G9a_Inhibitors_efficacy)

**What we tried**

- Cloned repo
- Opened the README to find how to run
- Attempted running from jupyter notebook

**What went wrong**

- No instruction in the README, only links to datasets
- After modifying first step of repo, realized that there was too much pre-processing to continue working on this project

**Conclusion**

- Could have been interesting, but required too much work for a short-term project

### Paper 2 - Dual inhibition of AChE and MAO-B in Alzheimer’s disease: machine learning approaches and model interpretations

- **Link to paper**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11030-024-11061-x?fromPaywallRec=false#Abs1
- **Code repo**: https://github.com/houzhe122/AChE-MAOB-Models

**What we tried**

- Cloned repo to run on terminal, since we are working with .py files
- Creating environments to run code

**What went wrong**

- No readme, but maybe because it's all python code
- Datasets missing while running

**Conclusion**

- Discard --> Cannot run normally as excel file is missing from repository

### Paper 3 – A machine-learning based objective measure for ALS disease severity

- **Link to paper**: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00588-8#Abs1
- **Code repo**:  https://github.com/pmphelp/paper-code

**What we tried**

- Cloned the GitHub repository and verified all code files were present
- Installed required dependencies (tensorflow, keras, numpy)
- Ran all provided Python scripts
- Reviewed .py files to identify model training, evaluation, and output steps

**What we observed**

- Scripts executed without runtime errors
- Code consists of model architecture definitions and preprocessing layers only
- No scripts initiate training or evaluation directly
- Running the files produced no terminal output and no saved result or figure files

**What went wrong**

- The repository doesn't include any end-to-end pipeline or post-processing code to reproduce the paper’s figures or metrics
- Additional custom scripts would be required to train models, export predictions, and generate figures

**Conclusion**

- The provided code does not reproduce any experimental results on its own
- Reproducing the paper’s figures is not possible using the repository as-is
- This represents a reproducibility limitation despite access to the model definitions

### Paper 5 - At-home wearables and machine learning sensitively capture disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

- **Link to paper**: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40917-3#
- **Code repo**:  https://github.com/mdsamchen/scz_bip_mdd/tree/main

**What we tried**

- Cloned github repository onto our terminal to run .py files

**What went wrong**

- No csv files in the repository to run the code

**Conclusion**

- Discard --> no data to run with the code

### Paper 7 - Predicting involuntary admission following inpatient psychiatric treatment using machine learning trained on electronic health record data

- **Link to paper**: https://www-cambridge-org.avoserv2.library.fordham.edu/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/predicting-involuntary-admission-following-inpatient-psychiatric-treatment-using-machine-learning-trained-on-electronic-health-record-data/BA8F21BBB66E0A6E49D792123C3FC093
- **Code repo**: https://github.com/Aarhus-Psychiatry-Research/psycop-common/tree/main/psycop/projects/forced_admission_inpatient

**What we tried**

- First solid readme with a good walkthrough of the pipeline
- Cloned to work with the .py files in my terminal

**What went wrong**

- Upon looking through the paper, realized the patient-level data is not to be shared according to law

**Conclusion**

- Very interesting code, however have to discard because of the data

### Paper 10 - An evaluation of machine learning approaches for early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder

- **Link to paper**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772442523001600
- **Code repo**: https://github.com/diponkor-bala/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder/tree/main

**What we tried**

- Cloned repository, looked like a lot of good .ipynb files to work with
- Nowhere to find instructions or files used

**What went wrong**

- Everything was ran on their google colab which is not provided access
- All files were in their google drive, accessed by formal request

**Conclusion**

- Discard --> cant reproduce without data
